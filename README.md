### Document
Note: one time change in `_config.yml`, when you want to host the webpage at `wcsng.github.io/wcsng`.
```
baseurl: "/wcsng"
```

Clone the repository. Install Jekyll. Run webpage on local server.
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This command builds the webpage in the `_site` folder with all the html, CSS, and files for your localserver. Use:
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```
to build the webpage in the `_site` that can be used for your webserver. Just add, commit, and push the content to Github OR copy it to your webserver.


How to edit the contents:

* `publist.yml` to add new paper index (title, abstract, authors, link).
* `research_list` six research categories details
* `students.yml` for masters students, `colaborations` and `alumni`
* `team_member.yml` for PhDs
* `news.yml`

## Installing Jekyll on Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev

echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

gem install jekyll bundler
```

Now check the `Gemfile.lock` file for the correct version number of the bundler and install it. For example, if file says it was `BUNDLED WITH 2.0.2`, then run:

```
gem i bundler -v 2.0.2
``` 

Install all required gems:

```
bundle install
```

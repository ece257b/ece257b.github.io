### Motivation
WiFi backscattering can enable direct connectivity of IoT de-vices with commodity WiFi hardware at low power. However,most existing work in this area has overlooked the importanceof synchronization and, as a result, accepted either limitedrange between the transmitter and the IoT device, reducedthroughput via bit repetition, or both.

### Overview 
we present SyncScatter, which achieves accurate synchronization with incident signals at the IoT device level while realizing maximum possible sensitivity afforded by a backscatter link budget. SyncScatter creates a novel modeling framework and derives the maximal optimal range and synchronization error that the receiver can tolerate without significant performance compromises. Next, SyncScatter builds a novel hierarchical wakeup protocol, which, together with a custom ASIC, achieves arange of 30+ meters and the peak throughput of 500Kbps, with an average power consumption of 30Î¼W.

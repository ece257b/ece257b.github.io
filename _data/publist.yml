- title: "Users are Closer than they Appear: Protecting User's Location from WiFi APs"
  image: mirage.png
  description: "Wi-Fi-based indoor localization has now matured for over a decade. Most of the current localization algorithms rely on the Wi-Fi access points (APs) in the enterprise network to localize the Wi-Fi user accurately. Thus, the Wi-Fi user's location information could be easily snooped by an attacker listening through a compromised Wi-Fi AP. With indoor localization and navigation being the next step towards automation, it is important to give users the capability to defend against such attacks. In this paper, we present MIRAGE, a system that can utilize the downlink physical layer information to create a defense against an attacker snooping on a Wi-Fi user's location information. MIRAGE achieves this by utilizing the  beamforming capability of the transmitter that is already part of the Wi-Fi standard protocols. With this initial idea, we have demonstrated that the user can obfuscate his/her location from the Wi-Fi AP always with no compromise to the throughput of the existing Wi-Fi communication system through the real-world prototype, and reduce the user location accuracy of the attacker from 2.3m to more than 10m through simulation."

- title: "ViWiD: Leveraging WiFi for Robust and Resource-Efficient SLAM"
  image: viwid.png
  description: "Recent interest towards autonomous navigation and exploration robots for indoor applications has spurred research into indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) robot systems. While most of these SLAM systems use Visual and LiDAR sensors in tandem with an odometry sensor, these odometry sensors drift over time. To combat this drift, Visual SLAM systems deploy compute and memory intensive search algorithms to detect `Loop Closures', which make the trajectory estimate globally consistent. To circumvent these resource (compute and memory) intensive algorithms, we present ViWiD, which integrates WiFi and Visual sensors in a dual-layered system. This dual-layered approach separates the tasks of local and global trajectory estimation making ViWiD resource efficient while achieving on-par or better performance to state-of-the-art Visual SLAM. We demonstrate ViWiD's performance on four datasets, covering over 1500 m of traversed path and show 4.3x and 4x reduction in compute and memory consumption respectively compared to state-of-the-art Visual and Lidar SLAM systems with on par SLAM performance."

  image: dpa.png
  description: "Modern mmWave systems have limited scalability due to inflexibility in performing frequency multiplexing. All the frequency components in the signal are beamformed to one direction via pencil beams and cannot be streamed to other user directions. We present a new flexible mmWave system called mmFlexible that enables flexible directional frequency multiplexing, where different frequency components of the mmWave signal are beamformed in multiple arbitrary directions with the same pencil beam. Our system makes two key contributions: (1) We propose a novel mmWave front-end architecture called a delay-phased array that uses a variable delay and variable phase element to create the desired frequency-direction response. (2) We propose a novel algorithm called FSDA (Frequency-space to delay-antenna) to estimate delay and phase values for the real-time operation of the delay-phased array. Through evaluations with mmWave channel traces, we show that mmFlexible provides a 60-150% reduction in worst-case latency compared to baselines."

  image: mmspoof.png
  description: "FMCW radars are integral to automotive driving for robust and weather-proof sensing of surrounding objects. At the same time, these radars are vulnerable to spoofing attacks that may cause sensor malfunction leading to fatal accidents. Many past works tried spoofing attacks on FMCW radars using an attacker device that generates spoofing signals, but they are not very effective as they require tight synchronization between the attacker and victim. We present a novel spoofing mechanism mmSpoof that is based on the reflection of radar signal with appropriate modulation to spoof the victim's radar. Our spoofing with a mmWave reflect array eliminates the need for synchronization and is robust to various security features and countermeasures of the victim's radar. We provide insights and mechanisms to flexibly spoof any distance and velocity on the victim's radar using a unique frequency shift at the mmSpoof's reflect array. mmSpoof designs a novel algorithm for estimating this frequency shift without assuming any prior information about the victim's radar. We develop a compact and mobile setup for mmSpoof using commercial-off-the-shelf components and show the effectiveness of spoofing in realistic automotive driving scenarios with commercial radars."

  image: p2slam.png
  description: "A recent spur of interest in indoor robotics has increased the importance of robust simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms in indoor scenarios. This robustness is typically provided by the use of multiple sensors which can correct each others’ deficiencies. In this vein, exteroceptive sensors, like cameras and LiDAR’s, employed for fusion are capable of correcting the drifts accumulated by wheel odometry or inertial measurement units (IMU’s). However, these exteroceptive sensors are deficient in highly structured environments and dynamic lighting conditions. This letter will present WiFi as a robust and straightforward sensing modality capable of circumventing these issues. Specifically, we make three contributions. First, we will understand the necessary features to be extracted from WiFi signals. Second, we characterize the quality of these measurements. Third, we integrate these features with odometry into a state-of-art GraphSLAM backend. We present our results in a 25×30 m and 50×40 environment and robustly test the system by driving the robot a cumulative distance of over 1225 m in these two environments. We show an improvement of at least 6× compared odometry-only estimation and perform on par with one of the state-of-the-art Visual-based SLAM."

- title: "Evaluating Physical-Layer BLE Location Tracking Attacks on Mobile Devices"
  image: BLE_attack.gif
  description: "Mobile devices increasingly function as wireless tracking beacons. Using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol, mobile devices such as smartphones and smartwatches continuously transmit beacons to inform passive listeners about device locations for applications such as digital contact tracing for COVID-19, and even finding lost devices. These applications use cryptographic anonymity that limit an adversary’s ability to use these beacons to stalk a user. However, attackers can bypass these defenses by fingerprinting the unique physical-layer imperfections in the transmissions of specific devices. We empirically demonstrate that there are several key challenges that can limit an attacker’s ability to find a stable physical layer identifier to uniquely identify mobile devices using BLE, including variations in the hardware design of BLE chipsets, transmission power levels, differences in thermal conditions, and limitations of inexpensive radios that can be widely deployed to capture raw physical-layer signals. We evaluated how much each of these factors limits accurate fingerprinting in a large-scale field study of hundreds of uncontrolled BLE devices, revealing that physical-layer identification is a viable, although sometimes unreliable, way for an attacker to track mobile devices."

The spatial features of sound signals received by each microphone are extracted and represented as likelihood surfaces for the sound source locations in each point. Our DNN consists of an encoder network followed by two decoders. The encoder obtains a compressed representation of the input likelihoods. One decoder resolves the multipath caused by reverberation, and the other decoder estimates the source location. Experiments based on both the simulated and experimental data show that our method can not only outperform multiple signal classification (MUSIC), steered response power with phase transform (SRP-PHAT), sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), and a competing convolutional neural network (CNN) approach in the reverberant environment but also achieve a good generalization performance."

  description: "Supervised learning-based sound source localization (SSL) methods have been shown to achieve a promising localization accuracy in the past. In this paper, MTIT, SSL for indoors using Multi-Task learning and Image Translation
network, an image translation-based deep neural networks (DNNs) framework for SSL is presented to predict the
locations of sound sources with random positions in a continuous space. We extract and represent the spatial features
of the sound signals as beam response at each direction which can indicate the chance of the source in each point of
the room. We utilize the multi-task learning (MTL) based training framework. There are one encoder and two
decoders in our DNN. The encoder aims to obtain a compressed representation of the input beamspectrum surfaces
while the two decoders focus on two tasks in parallel. One decoder focuses on resolving the multipath caused by
reverberation and the other decoder predicts the source location. Since these two decoders share the same encoder,
by training these two decoders in parallel, the shared representations are refined. We comprehensively evaluate the
localization performance of our method in the simulated data, measured impulse response and real recordings datasets and compare it with multiple signal classification, steered response power with phase transform, and a competing convolutional neural network approach. It turns out that MTIT can outperform all of the baseline methods in a

  description: "Millimeter-wave communication with high throughput and high reliability is poised to be a gamechanger for V2X and VR applications. However, mmWave links are notorious for low reliability since they suffer from frequent outages due to blockage and user mobility. We build mmReliable, a reliable mmWave system that implements multi-beamforming and user tracking to handle environmental vulnerabilities. It creates constructive multi-beam patterns and optimizes their angle, phase, and amplitude to maximize the signal strength at the receiver. Multi-beam links are reliable since they are resilient to occasional blockages of few constituent beams compared to a single-beam system. We implement mmReliable on a 28 GHz testbed with 400 MHz bandwidth, and a 64 element phased array supporting 5G NR waveforms. Rigorous indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that mmReliable achieves close to 100% reliability providing 2.3x improvement in the throughput-reliability product than single-beam systems."

  description: "WiFi backscattering can enable direct connectivity of IoT devices with commodity WiFi hardware at low power. However, most existing work in this area has overlooked the importance of synchronization and have, as a result, accepted either limited range between the transmitter and the IoT device, reduced throughput via bit repetition, or both. In this paper, we present SyncScatter, which achieves accurate synchronization to incident signals at the IoT device level, while also achieving sensitivity commensurate with the maximum possible afforded by a backscattering link budget. SyncScatter creates a novel modeling framework, and derives the maximal optimal range and synchronization error that can be achieved without major performance compromises. Next, SyncScatter builds a novel hierarchical wake-up protocol, which together with a custom ASIC, achieves a range of 30+ meters at 2Mbps, with an average power consumption of 25.2µW."

  image: wiforce.png
  description: "Contact force is a natural way for humans to interact with the physical world around us. However, most of our interactions with the digital world are largely based on a simple binary sense of touch (contact or no contact). Similarly, when interacting with robots to perform complex tasks, such as surgery, richer force information that includes both magnitude and contact location is important for task performance. To address these challenges, we present the design and fabrication of WiForce which is a ‘wireless’ sensor, sentient to contact force magnitude and location. WiForce achieves this by transducing force magnitude and location, to phase changes of an incident RF signal of a backscattering tag. The phase changes are thus modulated into the backscattered RF signal, which enables measurement of force magnitude and contact location by inferring the phases of the reflected RF signal. WiForce’s sensor is designed to support wide-band frequencies all the way up to 3 GHz. We evaluate the force sensing wirelessly in different environments, including through phantom tissue, and achieve force accuracy of 0.3 N and contact location accuracy of 0.6 mm."

  description: "Drones have carried weapons, drugs, explosives and illegal packages in the recent past, raising strong concerns from public authorities. While existing drone monitoring systems only focus on detecting drone presence, localizing or fingerprinting the drone, there is a lack of a solution for estimating the additional load carried by a drone. In this paper, we present a novel passive RF system, namely DroneScale, to monitor the wireless signals transmitted by commercial drones and then confirm their models and loads. Our key technical contribution is a proposed technique to passively capture vibration at high resolution (i.e., 1Hz vibration) from afar, which was not possible before. We prototype DroneScale using COTS RF components and illustrate that it can monitor the body vibration of a drone at the targeted resolution. In addition, we develop learning algorithms to extract the physical vibration of the drone from the transmitted signal to infer the model of a drone and the load carried by it. We evaluate the DroneScale system using 5 different drone models, which carry external loads of up to 400g. The experimental results show that the system is able to estimate the external load of a drone with an average accuracy of 96.27%. We also analyze the sensitivity of the system with different load placements with respect to the drone’s body, flight modes, and distances up to 200 meters."

  description: "Autonomous perception requires high-quality environment sensing
in the form of 3D bounding boxes of dynamic objects. The primary
sensors used in automotive systems are light-based cameras and
LiDARs. However, they are known to fail in adverse weather conditions.
Radars can potentially solve this problem as they are barely
affected by adverse weather conditions. However, specular reflections
of wireless signals cause poor performance of radar point
clouds.We introduce Pointillism, a system that combines data from
multiple spatially separated radars with an optimal separation to
mitigate these problems. We introduce a novel concept of Cross
Potential Point Clouds, which uses the spatial diversity induced by
multiple radars and solves the problem of noise and sparsity in radar
point clouds. Furthermore, we present the design of RP-net, a novel
deep learning architecture, designed explicitly for radar’s sparse
data distribution, to enable accurate 3D bounding box estimation.
The spatial techniques designed and proposed in this paper are
fundamental to radars point cloud distribution and would benefit
other radar sensing applications."

  description: "Solving depth estimation with monocular cameras enables the possibility of widespread use of cameras as low-cost depth estimation sensors in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, learning such a scalable depth estimation model would require a lot of labeled data which is expensive to collect. There are two popular existing approaches which do not require annotated depth maps: (i) using labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data in an adversarial framework to predict more accurate depth, and (ii) unsupervised models which exploit geometric structure across space and time in monocular video frames. Ideally, we would like to leverage features provided by both approaches as they complement each other; however, existing methods do not adequately exploit these additive benefits. We present S 3Net, a selfsupervised framework which combines these complementary features: we use synthetic and real-world images for training while exploiting geometric, temporal, as well as semantic constraints. Our novel consolidated architecture provides a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised depth estimation using monocular videos. We present a unique way to train this self-supervised framework, and achieve (i) more than 15% improvement over previous synthetic supervised approaches that use domain adaptation and (ii) more than 10% improvement over previous self-supervised approaches which exploit geometric constraints from the real data"

- title: "ScatterMIMO: Enabling Virtual MIMO with Smart Surfaces"
  image: scattermimo.png
  description: "In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial
multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by orders
of magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement
in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude
effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present
ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering
in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain.
Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device
say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power
as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive
APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and
power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems
by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to
provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very
low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs
can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real
active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore,
we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO’s smart surface for
each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome
random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our
evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi
(11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median
throughput improvement of 2x over the active AP alone."

- title: "Deep Learning based Wireless Localization for Indoor Navigation"
  image: dloc.png
  description: "Location services, fundamentally, rely on two components- a mapping system and a positioning system. The mapping system provides the physical map of the space, and the positioning system identifies the position within the map. Outdoor location services have thrived over the last couple of decades because of well-establishedplatforms for both these components (e.g. Google Maps for mapping, and GPS for positioning). In contrast, indoor location services haven’t caught up because of the lack of reliable mapping and positioning frameworks, as GPS is known not to work indoors. WiFi positioning lacks maps and is also prone to environmental errors. In this paper, we present DLoc, a Deep Learning based wireless localization algorithm that can overcome traditional limitations of RF-based localization approaches (like multipath, occlusions, etc.). DLoc uses data from the mapping platform we developed, MapFind, that can construct location-tagged maps of the environment. Together, they allow off-the-shelf WiFi devices like smartphones toaccess a map of the environment and to estimate their position withrespect to that map. During our evaluation, MapFind has collected location estimates of over 120 thousand points under 10 different scenarios across two different spaces covering 2000 sq. Ft. DLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WiFi-based localizationby 80% (median and 90th percentile) across the 2000 sq. ft. spanningtwo different spaces."

- title: "LocAP: Accurate Localization of Existing WiFi Infrastructure"
  image: loc_ap.png
  description: "Indoor localization has been studied for nearly two decades fueled by wide interest in indoor navigation, achieving the necessary decimeter-level accuracy. However, there are no real-world deployments of WiFi-based user localization algorithms, primarily because these algorithms are triangulation based and therefore assume the location of the Access Points, their antenna geometries, and deployment orientations in the physical map. In the real world, such detailed knowledge of the location attributes of the Access Point is seldom available, thereby making WiFi localization hard to deploy. In this paper, for the first time, we establish the accuracy requirements for the location attributes of access points to achieve decimeter level user localization accuracy. Surprisingly, these requirements for antenna geometries and deployment orientation are very stringent, requiring millimeter level and sub-10 degree of accuracy respectively, which is hard to achieve with manual effort. To ease the deployment of real-world WiFi localization, we present LocAP, which is an autonomous system to physically map the environment and accurately locate the attributes of existing infrastructure AP in the physical space down to the required stringent accuracy of 3 mm antenna separation and 3degree deployment orientation median errors, whereas state-of-the-art report 150 mm and 25degrees respectively."

  image: capttery.png
  description: Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are becoming widely adopted, but they increasingly suffer from limited power, as power cords cannot reach the billions and batteries do not last forever. Existing systems address the issue with ultra-low-power designs and energy scavenging, which inevitably limit functionality. To unlock the full potential of ubiquitous computing and connectivity, our solution uses capacitive power transfer (CPT) to provide battery-like wireless power delivery, henceforth referred to as "Capttery". Capttery presents the first room-level (~5 m) CPT system, which delivers continuous milliwatt-level wireless power to multiple IoT devices concurrently. Unlike conventional one-to-one CPT systems that target kilowatt power in a controlled and potentially hazardous setup, Capttery is designed to be human-safe and invariant in a practical and dynamic environment. Our evaluation shows that Capttery can power end-to-end IoT applications across a typical room, where new receivers can be easily added in a plug-and-play manner.

  image: sparSDR.png
  description: "We present SparSDR, a resource-efficient architecture for softwaredefined radios whose backhaul bandwidth and compute power requirements scale in inverse proportion to the sparsity (in time and frequency) of the signals received. SparSDR requires dramatically fewer resources than existing approaches to process many popular protocols while retaining both flexibility and fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach has negligible impact on signal quality, receiver sensitivity, and processing latency. The SparSDR architecture makes it possible to capture signals across bandwidths far wider than the capacity of a radio's backhaul through the addition of lightweight frontend processing and corresponding backend reconstruction to restore the signals to their original sample rate. We employ SparSDR to develop two wideband applications running on a USRP N210 and a Raspberry Pi 3+: an IoT sniffer that scans 100 MHz of bandwidth and decodes received BLE packets, and a wideband Cloud SDR receiver that requires only residential-class Internet uplink capacity. We show that our SparSDR implementation fits in the constrained resources of popular low-cost SDR platforms, such as the AD Pluto."

  image: sweepsense.png
  description: "Wireless transmissions occur intermittently across the entire spectrum. For example, WiFi and Bluetooth devices transmit frames across the 100 MHz-wide 2.4 GHz band, and LTE devices transmit frames between 700 MHz and 3.7 GHz). Today, only high-cost radios can sense across the spectrum with sufficient temporal resolution to observe these individual transmissions. We present “SweepSense”, a low-cost radio architecture that senses the entire spectrum with high-temporal resolution by rapidly sweeping across it. Sweeping introduces new challenges for spectrum sensing: SweepSense radios only capture a small number of distorted samples of transmissions. To overcome this challenge, we correct the distortion with self-generated calibration data, and classify the protocol that originated each transmission with only a fraction of the transmission’s samples. We demonstrate that SweepSense can accurately identify four protocols transmitting simultaneously in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band. We also demonstrate that it can simultaneously monitor the load of several LTE base stations operating in disjoint bands."

  image: signet.png
  description: "Unsupervised learning for geometric perception (depth, optical flow, etc.) is of great interest to autonomous systems. Recent works on unsupervised learning have made considerable progress on perceiving geometry; however, they usually ignore the coherence of objects and perform poorly under scenarios with dark and noisy environments. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms, which are robust, require large labeled geometric dataset. This paper introduces SIGNet, a novel framework that provides robust geometry perception without requiring geometrically informative labels. Specifically, SIGNet integrates semantic information to make depth and flow predictions consistent with objects and robust to low lighting conditions. SIGNet is shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning for depth prediction by 30% (in squared relative error). In particular, SIGNet improves the dynamic object class performance by 39% in depth prediction and 29% in flow prediction.

  image: bloc.png
  description: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags have become very prevalent over the last decade for tracking applications in homes as well as businesses. These tags are used to track objects, navigate people, and deliver contextual advertisements. However, in spite of the wide interest in tracking BLE tags, the primary methods of tracking them are based on signal strength (RSSI) measurements. Past work has shown that such methods are inaccurate, and prone to multipath and dynamic environments. As a result, localization using Wi-Fi has moved to Channel State Information (CSI, includes both signal strength and signal phase) based localization methods. In this paper, we seek to investigate what are the challenges that prevent BLE from adopting CSI based localization methods. We identify fundamental differences at the PHY layer between BLE and Wi-Fi, that make it challenging to extend CSI based localization to BLE. We present our system, BLoc, that incorporates novel, BLE-compatible algorithms to overcome these challenges and enable an accurate, multipath-resistant localization system. Our empirical evaluation shows that BLoc can achieve a localization accuracy of 86 cm with BLE tags, a 3X improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline.

- title: Enabling high-quality untethered virtual reality
  image: movr.png
  description: "Today’s virtual reality (VR) headsets require a cable connection to a PC or game console. This cable significantly
limits the player’s mobility and, hence, her VR experience. The high data rate requirement of this link (multiple Gbps) precludes its replacement by WiFi. Thus, in
this paper, we focus on using mmWave technology to deliver multi-Gbps wireless communication between VR
headsets and their game consoles. We address the two
key problems that prevent existing mmWave links from
being used in VR systems. First, mmWave signals suffer from a blockage problem, i.e., they operate mainly
in line-of-sight and can be blocked by simple obstacles
such as the player lifting her hand in front of the headset.
Second, mmWave radios use highly directional antennas
with very narrow beams; they work only when the transmitter’s beam is aligned with the receiver’s beam. Any
small movement of the headset can break the alignment
and stall the data stream. We present MoVR, a novel
system that allows mmWave links to sustain high data
rates even in the presence of a blockage and mobility.
MoVR does this by introducing a smart mmWave mirror and leveraging VR headset tracking information. We
implement MoVR and empirically demonstrate its performance using an HTC VR headset."

802.11b transmissions from a commodity WiFi transmitter,

translation, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its
information on standard 802.11b packets by just translating the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another
valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver
to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors
for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter communication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We
show experimentally that HitchHike can achieve an uplink
throughput of up to 300Kbps at ranges of up to 34m and

SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi
incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately

even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas.
Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our

that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath."

its super-resolution algorithms to estimate the direction of
the target device and novel triangulation algorithms which

- title: "Full duplex backscatter"
  image: fdback.png
  description: "This paper asks the following question: could we transform
the radios found in our personal gadgets into powerful multipurpose scanning devices that can detect and locate tumors,
guns, buried human bodies, a la the Star Trek Tricoder? Our
key insight is that if radios could measure the backscatter
of their own transmissions (i.e. reflections from the environment of their transmissions), then Tricorder-style powerful object detection and localization algorithms could be
realized. In this paper we focus specifically on backscatter
measurement, we describe novel circuits and algorithms that
can be added to existing radios to enable them to accurately
and concurrently receive and disentangle their own transmissions’ reflections and infer its properties."

- title: "Full duplex radios"
  image: fullduplex.png
  description: "This paper presents the design and implementation of the first in-band full duplex WiFi radios that can simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel using standard WiFi 802.11ac PHYs and achieves close to the theoretical doubling of throughput in all practical deployment scenarios. Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice."

  description: "This paper presents a full duplex radio design using signal inversion
and adaptive cancellation. Signal inversion uses a simple design
based on a balanced/unbalanced (Balun) transformer. This new design, unlike prior work, supports wideband and high power systems. In theory, this new design has no limitation on bandwidth or
power. In practice, we find that the signal inversion technique alone
can cancel at least 45dB across a 40MHz bandwidth. Further, combining signal inversion cancellation with cancellation in the digital
domain can reduce self-interference by up to 73dB for a 10MHz
OFDM signal."
